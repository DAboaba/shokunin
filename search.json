I am an economist by training, a programmer by accident, and a data scientist at heart.\nI‚Äôve heard data scientists described as people who are better statisticians than most software engineers and better software engineers than most statisticians, and I‚Äôve never felt more seen üòÇ.\nI am an avid reader üìö, gamer üéÆ, learner üî¨ and tinkerer üîß.\nshokunin1 is my data-science and machine-learning blog where I leverage my interest in learning, writing, programming, and popular culture to irreverently pursue continued improvement in my craft."

    "text": "Photo by Patrick Tomasso on Unsplash\nIn a previous post I discussed keeping running lists of resources I want to come back to. In addition to these, I‚Äôve decided to also keep a list of future ideas for shokunin. Although I initially balked at the idea of posting my unfinished plans, I really do want shokunin to be a ‚Äúplace‚Äù where I can cultivate, refine, and share my interconnected thoughts and ideas.1 While I think I can cultivate and share my musings already, I think showing the process of refining an initial idea can only be done by showing different ideas at different stages of development. Additionally, I think keeping a list of future ideas can also act as an easy commitment device2.\nSo consider my list of future ideas an informal contract/promise about what‚Äôs likely coming up for shokunin. That said, I make absolutely no promises about the quality and tidyness of those ideas. What I do promise is that the idea at the very top will always be those I‚Äôm currently spending the most time working on.\nDedicated to craft,\nDami"

In Japan there is a strong culture of shokunin ‚Ä¶ a person that is always pursuing to better his craft‚Äù.\nShokunin describes an orientation to work that emphasizes dedication to craft through exceptional technical skill and an unwavering quest for mastery. Jiro Ono, the star of ‚ÄòJiro Dreams of Sushi‚Äô and already a sushi master by every conventional standard, stands out and continues to passionately refine his craft because his aspiration is excellence itself.¬†\nI‚Äôve chosen to name this blog ‚Äòshokunin‚Äô to reflect my desire to apply this philosophy to the data science and machine learning work I share here.
